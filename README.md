# AEdeficem (College Project)

### **[Game Trailer](https://vimeo.com/289092507)**

AEdificem is a 2.5D Turn Based Resource Manager Simulation game where the player manages a 
country to stop it from falling into disarray by maintaining its available resources and allocating 
those resources to events to help bring sustainability. I worked as the Lead Developer of the project, implementing a majority of the mechanics.

### Resources and Cities

  </p>
There are 2 types of resources. Region resources (water, food and electricity) and Action Points. Both of these replenish. Resources are gained via the 
production in a city per region. Resource production depend on region quality, the lower the quality the less resources produced and vice versa. The Action Points of a player are always replenished to 10 every turn.
  
### Events

In each turn events will appear that adversely affect the region, a max of 3 events can spawn on a region. Player must resolve these events by sending manpower to prepare for 
resolving.

  </p>
These events must be resolved by the player by expending resources to avoid adverse effects on the region. Sending manpower will always cost 1 Action Point and Events have a 
turn timer until they are marked failed.
 
### Research

The player can also choose to research a special project or technology that can help them in their playthrough. There are 3
branches that the player can begin research on; 1 Disaster Preparedness, 2 Resource Production and 3 Regional Planning.
