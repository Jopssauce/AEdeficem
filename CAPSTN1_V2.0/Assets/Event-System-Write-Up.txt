Event System Flow

	1. On Turn Start the game will spawn 2 to 5 events
		- 2 Events Spawn
			-> 1 Event will spawn on the lowest quality region.
			-> 1 will be for the priority of Short Term looping on Chain Type.
			-> if no short term looping is found then Domino Type Child Event can spawn.
		- 3 Events
			-> 1 Event will spawn on the lowest quality region.
			-> 1 will be for the priority of Short Term looping on Chain Type.
			-> 1 will be for the priority of Domino Type Child Events.
		- 4 Events
			-> 1 Event will spawn on the lowest quality region.
			-> 1 will be for the priority of Short Term looping on Chain Type.
			-> 2 will be for the priority of Domino Type Child Events.
		- 5 Events
			-> 2 Event will spawn on the lowest quality region.
			-> 1 will be for the priority of Short Term looping on Chain Type.
			-> 2 will be for the priority of Domino Type Child Events.
		
		- *Should there be more than one Short Term looping on Chain Type, prioritize spawning by lowest quality(the region with the lowest quality will have the Short Term looped event).
		- *Should there be more than one Domino Type Child Event
		- *Should the checking for Short Term looping and Domino Type Child Events come out empty then the protocol would be a randomized an event spawn.
		
	2. Specifics on Chain Type
		- Appearance:
			-> will be shown as a standard event(including color and symbol)
			-> its type by the inspector and code though should be Chain Type NOT standard type
		- Choices:
			-> Long Term Choice(resolve button)
			-> Short Term Choice(resolve button)
			-> Cancel(X button)
		- Short Term Choice
			-> when chosen by the player, the event loop back after X amount of turns(depends on the event details).
			-> upon looping back the short term cost will have an increase in cost(Ex: Initial cost is only 4 food, Loop 1 cost is now 5 food)
			-> its reward is like the standard type rewards; a one time increase in Region Quality
		- Long Term Choice
			-> when chosen by the player, the event must be initially resolved like any other event.
			-> the initial resolve will only give +1% to region quality.
			-> after the initial resolve, this will then spawn X number of child events(Persistent Events::Chain Variant; scroll down/look down for specifics)
			-> after all the child events have been resolved the reward will be instead increasing Region Quality over X amount of turns instead of the regular loss of quality
			
		- Persistent Events::Chain Variant
			-> these will spawn after the initial resolve from the Long Term Choice.
			-> these events are persistent, meaning they have no turn expiration.
			-> these events have no negative effects or repercussions.
			-> as per sir David's request add an overall cancel should the player decide to just to flat out stop
			-> these also give out no quality reward or any sort of reward
		
		- *Only one Chain Type can be on the field(like the mega-structures in stellaris but unlike stellaris there can only be on the field/scene since stellaris can have multiple unbuilt
		   mega-structures).
		- *Only on the phase where the Persistent Event::Chain Variant have spawned is when the "No Negative Effects" point come in, if the event is still on the choice between the long term
		   and short term then the turn timer and its subsequent negative effects apply.
		- *Only the Persistent Event::Chain Variants will have the appearance(color and symbol) of the Chain Type.
			
		
	3. Specifics on Domino Type
		- Appearance:
			-> it will be shown as its type design(color and symbol)
		- Choices:
			-> Resolve A
			-> Resolve B
			-> Cancel (X button)
		
		- *Up to the assignment in the inspector whether Resolve A or B will lead to Domino Type Child Event
		
		- Choice That Leads to Domino Type Child Event
			-> when chosen by the player, the event will go through an initial resolve(like standard types).
			-> after the initial resolve, the event may spawn a Persistent Event::Domino Variant with a bound event or a solo Persistent Event::Domino Variant or a just another 
			   Event with the Domino Type.
			-> resolving any of the child events it spawns may spawn another child event(this depends on the event details on the inspector).
			-> once the "Domino Effect" has ended depending whether the player has successfully run down through all of the child events and choices that came up without prematurely ending the
			   "Domino Effect", then the reward will be like the Chain Type's reward; increasing Region Quality over X amount of turns instead of the regular loss of quality as well as
			   a one-time reward of resources.
		
		- The choice that doesn't lead to Domino Type Child Event
			-> this choice is considered as the premature ending of the Domino Effect.
			-> the rewards of this will be like the standard type.
			-> the presentation of this event isn't just tied to the format of the standard type, this can appear as any of the possible Child Events that can spawn(Persistent Event::Domino Variant with 
			   a bound event or a solo Persistent Event::Domino Variant or a just another Event with the Domino Type)
		
		- Persistent Event::Domino Variant
			-> spawns as a Child Event of a Domino Type
			-> these are persistent as well but not all are indefinite(no expiration).
			-> the properties are like global events; they have a constant negative effect on the region
			-> will require the player to constantly allocate manpower to suppress the negative effect
			-> once manpower is allocated the player will have to manually remove the allocation to free up manpower
			-> this will only disappear after the bound event is resolved(if there is a bound event) or if it has an expiration.
		
		- Bound Events
			-> the format of this is like the standard event
			-> this will only spawn if a Persistent Event::Domino Variant is specified to spawn with it(determined via unity inspector)
			-> when this is resolved the Persistent Event::Domino Variant it's tied to will disappear
		
		- Child Events
			-> Persistent Event::Domino Variant with a bound event
			-> Solo Persistent Event::Domino Variant
				+ this is the instance where a Persistent Event::Domino Variant spawns without a bound event and has an expiration.
			-> Event with the Domino Type
				+ standard format
